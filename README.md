Seems to generally work better from the command line.

kapt3 and auto-service seems to be problematic

Sometimes auto-service won't generate the `javax.annotation.processing.Processor` file. This means that no output files are generated by the example app.

The file should be here: `./jonty-processor/build/tmp/kapt3/classes/main/META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor`

The following has been verified with kapt3 and auto-service rc3

- `./gradlew clean :jonty-processor:build`
- `find . -name "javax.annotation.processing.Processor"`
- `./gradlew :example:build`
- `ls <outputdir>`

Perhaps it's the IDE interfering with it?
Note: `./gradlew clean` **does** remove the `Processor` file.
Sometimes it seemed that changing back between rc2 and rc3 made it able to generate the `Processor` file.
